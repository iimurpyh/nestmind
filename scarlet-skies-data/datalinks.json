Once armed, any signal other than the arming code will cause detonation. Warheads cannot be detonated underneath islands.\n\nThe effect of the explosion differs depending on where the Warhead was detonated:\n\n-Airburst: Generates an EMP, damaging power systems and jamming wireless parts in a huge area.\n-Surface: Fireball radius is reduced, but releases much larger amounts of radioactive fallout.\n-Underwater: No flash burns or aerial fallout.\n\nNuclear EMP does not affect parts in space or underwater.\n\nWhile the Warhead alone is effective against virtually any type of target, the explosion can be modified or enhanced even further by attachments:\n\n-Plutonium or PhotonShard: Increases explosion power by 50% per piece.\n-DeuteriumCap: When used along with at least one PhotonShard or Plutonium, the explosion \ngoes thermonuclear and power is doubled (including Plutonium/PhotonShard bonus). -Americium: Increases both radius and intensity of the radioactive fallout by 50% per piece.\n-EnrichedUranium: Increases duration of the radioactive fallout by 50% per piece.\n-Silicon: Removes EMP effect of airbursts.\n\nTo create a temporal bomb (Earth server and Officer rank only), attach a Warhead to a TimeMachine. When the Warhead is signaled (does not require arming conditions), all parts within a 100-stud radius are replaced by parts brought back from the date selected. This regenerates destroyed buildings and items. Attach an EnergyBomb to the TimeMachine to increase the radius to 400.\n\nUnlike most other parts, Warheads can never be unlocked by other players when unwelded.

        "rawBody": "Warheads are atomic bombs capable of catastrophic damage and surviving re-entry.\n\nTo arm a Warhead, two conditions must be reached: the Warhead needs to travel at a speed\nof at least 50 studs per second for the last 6 seconds, and it has to have been previously\nsignaled with the arming code that can be changed using the Hammer's Config tool. Once \narmed, any signal other than the arming code will cause detonation. Warheads cannot be\ndetonated underneath islands.\n\nThe effect of the explosion differs depending on where the Warhead was detonated:\n\n-Airburst: Generates an EMP, damaging power systems and jamming wireless parts in a huge area.\n-Surface: Fireball radius is reduced, but releases much larger amounts of radioactive fallout.\n-Underwater: No flash burns or aerial fallout.\n\nNuclear EMP does not affect parts in space or underwater.\n\nWhile the Warhead alone is effective against virtually any type of target, the explosion can be\nmodified or enhanced even further by attachments:\n\n-Plutonium or PhotonShard: Increases explosion power by 50% per piece.\n-DeuteriumCap: When used along with at least one PhotonShard or Plutonium, the explosion \ngoes thermonuclear and power is doubled (including Plutonium/PhotonShard bonus).\n-Americium: Increases both radius and intensity of the radioactive fallout by 50% per piece.\n-EnrichedUranium: Increases duration of the radioactive fallout by 50% per piece.\n-Silicon: Removes EMP effect of airbursts.\n\nTo create a temporal bomb (Earth server and Officer rank only), attach a Warhead to a \nTimeMachine. When the Warhead is signaled (does not require arming conditions), all parts \nwithin a 100-stud radius are replaced by parts brought back from the date selected. This \nregenerates destroyed buildings and items. Attach an EnergyBomb to the TimeMachine to \nincrease the radius to 400.\n\nUnlike most other parts, Warheads can never be unlocked by other players when unwelded. However,\nthey are vulnerable to large explosions and Flak bursts while in motion.\n\nWarheads defuse themselves if detonated too close to a BaseCenter outside of events.",

            "Due to ROBLOX Age Segregation, letters from player input are now hidden.\n\nYewscript is a programming language unique to Scarlet Skies, used by in-game Computers.\n\nThe Keyboard's GUI has an upper and lower window for entering YewScript programs depending on the user's preference. In the upper window, instructions are seperated by new lines, and by slashes in the lower window. No spaces are used in the programming syntax (besides any spaces contained in strings).\n\nExample for lower window: A=0/printA/A+1/goto2\n\nExample for upper window:\n\nA=0\nprintA\nA+1\ngoto2\n\n",
            "**=====SYNTAX=====**\n\nNote that programs will only run if containing more than one instruction.\n\nEach statement begins with its case-sensitive word, followed by arguments seperated from each other by apostrophes ('), but not seperated from the word.\n\nExamples: printHello/wait3, signalHello'2/wait3\n\nThe only exception to this order is when setting or performing arithmetic on a variable, where the variable is first, followed by an operator.\n\nExamples: A=Hello/printA/wait3, C=0/C+10/printC/wait3\n\n\"if\" statements are also formed a bit differently, with no seperation between the arguments besides for the operator used. When the statement is false, all code between the \"if\" statement and the next \"end\" will be skipped. \"else\" may also be used in between these. Undefined variables are referred to as \"nil\".\n\nExample: ifC>0/printLarger/else/printSmaller/end/wait3\n\nVariables are referenced using capital letters from A to Z, giving a total of twenty-six RAM slots. Lists and dictionaries can be indexed in variables (except in instructions which begin with a variable) using the \"\\`\" character followed by a number or key.\n\nExamples: H=100/H\\\\2/printH/wait3, B=a;b;c/printB\\`2/wait3\n\nLists are simply strings/numbers seperated by semicolons \";\". Variable Z is special in that it is overwritten while looping through a \"for\" list, which is set to each item in the list as it loops. You may add to or remove from a list using \"insert\" and \"remove\".\n\nExample: A=One;Two;Three/forA/printZ/wait1/endloop\n\nDictionaries are pairs of keys and data seperated by colons \":\", with an additional colon at the\nbeginning, end, and between each pair. Use the \"dict\" instruction to remove (by setting to nil) or add entry pairs, which can then be indexed in the same way lists are indexed (A=B\\`1). \"for\" and \"A=Size\" also operate on dictionaries similarly to lists.\n\nExample: A=:User1::123:User2::456:/B=A\\`User2/printB/leapto0\n\nThe \"goto\" and \"leapto\" instructions are used to jump to a specific line in the program, and can create loops if jumping to a previous section.\n\nExamples: B=2/B\\*2/printB/goto2, printPermanent Message!/leapto0\n\nComments (notes/markers that do nothing) are created by placing a \"-\" at the beginning of a line, as in wait1/-Marker/goto1.\n\n",

A Refinery must be present in the world to begin an Event.\n\nOnce an Event has been voted for, players have 60 seconds to vote for Event settings, which change the gameplay in various ways. 50% of votes are required to enable a setting.\n\nDuring an Event, the world year does not advance and parts do not save; when the Event ends, the world will be restored to the way it was before the Event.\n\n",
            "**WAR**\n\nObjective: Destroy all enemy BaseCenters.\nRules: Only enemy team may be attacked.\nLives: Unlimited\nAverage length: 1 hour\n\n-BaseCenters are highly vulnerable to attack if located adjacent to enemy territory. Destroy them to prevent enemies from respawning - territories cannot be captured if any enemy players are present. Territory capture speed increases with the amount of territory your team owns along with 50% of what other teams own. Only Warheads can destroy non-adjacent enemy BaseCenters.\n\n-Each player receives 30 credits/minute plus 2 credits/minute for each territory controlled. When a territory is captured, all parts within are unlocked and transferred to the attacking team's control so that they may be repurposed or sold (as long as their owner isn't nearby). Resource mining can provide yet another source of income. \n\n-In TripleThreat mode, three teams are created. Beware of the team furthest away, as they will often grow stronger while the other two fight amongst themselves.\n\n-Drought mode transforms all of the ocean (except for a few patches) into land, allowing long-distance conflicts with land vehicles. All territory in this mode can be captured without seacraft.\n\n",
            "**PVP**\n\nObjective: Destroy more players than anyone else until the time runs out.\nRules: Any player or object may be attacked.\nLives: Unlimited\nAverage length: 10 minutes\n\n-Resetting your character or dying of natural causes will cost you a point.\n\n-Take advantage of your enemy's reload time and attack while they are vulnerable.\n\n-Mayhem mode allows any part, including strong parts such as Eridanium, to be damaged by regular weapons. Use this to eliminate hiding places or to cause chaos.\n\n-Catch mode spawns weapons randomly in the area, causing them to be harder to obtain but also allowing you to carry several at once.\n\n",
            "**MACGYVER**\n\nObjective: Reach the green goal.\nRules: No attacking allowed.\nLives: Unlimited\nAverage length: 15 minutes\n\n-Don't hoard parts to yourself. Collaborate with other players to gather enough materials to make a working vehicle out of. All players win or lose together; the player who reached the goal gets no recognition.\n\n-If you can't find a particular item, see if you can manufacture it using ingredients found in the junk pile or even from natural resources.\n\n-Wind speed is low during MacGyver, making Sails useless.\n\n-In WrightBros mode, the goal will be too high for some types of aircraft such as helicopters.\n\n",
            "**COLD WAR**\n\nObjective: Protect all of your team's BaseCenters until the time runs out.\nRules: Only enemy team may be attacked after nuclear war begins.\nLives: Unlimited\nAverage length: 35 minutes\n\n-A peaceful resolution to Cold War awards the participants large sums of Credits. If you desire peace, try contacting the opposing team using a Radio.\n\n-Attacking with non-nuclear weapons is not allowed until a BaseCenter is damaged by a Warhead, but spy drones or satellites can help gather information about your opponent's capabilities and intentions. Jamming, cyberwarfare, or other forms of indirect espionage are also permitted.\n\n-Cold War is mainly an event for advanced players with custom models. The Nuclear MRBM and Nuclear SLBM Sub prefabs are available for those who are less experienced, although these have a limited range and are fairly complicated to use. For these reasons, Cold War is more relaxed than most Events in terms of team contribution; there's no shame in not helping.\n\n-Although nuclear weapons can be delivered by aircraft, they are easily shot down. ICBMs - rockets which cruise through Earth orbit and drop Warheads on targets from space - are much more difficult to defend against, and even carry some resistance to Interceptors. Submarines can also be used as surprise launch platforms.\n\n-Fizzle is the chance for Warheads to fail when detonation is attempted. The Fizzle chance goes down between 20 and 30 minutes in, so you must strike a balance as to when to launch your Warheads. Too early, and most or all of them will fizzle and be wasted; too late, and the enemy might wipe out your Warheads on the ground in a surprise attack. Warheads will also fizzle if launched into space while the Fizzle chance is still above 90%.\n\n-Nuclear explosions high in the air emit an invisible EMP pulse which damages electronics in a very large radius. A single nuclear EMP in the right place can disarm entire salvos or wreak havoc on base systems.\n\n",
            "**CHAMPION**\n\nObjective: Survive until all other players are dead or until time runs out.\nRules: Any player or object may be attacked.\nLives: 1-3\nAverage length: 25 minutes\n\n-Champion is for fighting, not hiding. Radioactive waste will spawn and build up around sedentary players.\n\n-Attack the strongest players first; they will be even harder to face if your vehicle is already damaged from previous fights.\n\n-In addition to the yellow beacons, Seekers can help to locate and hunt down enemies.\n\n-Extra fuel and supplies can be found at abandoned bases.\n\n",
            "**PIRACY**\n\nObjective: Cash in the most treasures until the time runs out.\nRules: Any player or object may be attacked.\nLives: Unlimited\nAverage length: 30 minutes\n\n-Ship crews are more formidable than going it alone. Credits can be donated to the captain for a larger (orreplacement) vessel, and keep in mind that the winner of Piracy can share the reward with up to three crew members.\n\n-Treasures detach and float to the surface if their carrier ship sinks. Aim for the hull of enemy ships to sink them and easily collect the loot.\n\n-The Squirt Gun is used to fight fires which will often break out on your ship during battles.\n\n-In Kraken mode, mechanical squids of monstrous proportions dwell in the waters. They have a taste for both you and your enemies - heed them, or lure them toward an opponent if possible.\n\n",
            "**SKIRMISH**\n\nObjective: Destroy all enemy players.\nRules: Only enemy team may be attacked.\nLives: 1\nAverage length: 10 minutes\n\n-Ideal Skirmish models should be made for large crews and prolonged battles. Using a regular model such as a biplane will work, but won't be as satisfying. Try structures too, such as castles and forts.\n\n-Aristocracy mode chooses the richest players first to spawn the Skirmish model, instead of choosing entirely at random. This helps improve the quality of the model, since rich players are more likely to have custom models available.\n\n-Vehicles loaded in Skirmish will be automatically filled with energy, fuel, and Ammo according to these rules - if the model uses a fuel (the fuel type is determined by the types of engines/motors within), the smallest Container and all Containers of the same size as the smallest will be filled with this fuel. All other Containers will be filled with Ammo. Containers with a set filter config will ignore these rules and be filled with the set substance.\n\n-Players will slowly be killed off if they stray too far from the enemy group (or vice versa). Keep up with the battle to avoid this tragic fate.\n\n",
            "**OUTLAW**\n\nObjective: Destroy the Outlaw before the time runs out or before all Eternity Gems are collected.\nRules: Only enemy team may be attacked.\nLives: 1 for the outlaw, unlimited for others\nAverage length: 15 minutes\n\n-In regular Outlaw, the player chosen as the outlaw (Red Team) must survive for 15 minutes against attack from everyone else in the server. The outlaw's advantage is a massive Credit income, while the advantage of Blue Team is sheer numbers.\n\n-In Eternity War Outlaw, the outlaw spawns with the Eternity Glove and must collect all 5 Eternity Gems - the nearest of which is marked by a green icon only visible to the outlaw. There is no time limit, and Blue Team also gets a significant income. Load each Gem as ammo into the Eternity Glove using the Produce menu. The Eternity Glove's ranged attack gets more powerful with each Gem obtained. Once all 5 Gems are loaded into the Eternity Glove, the outlaw may click anywhere to commit the Snap and win the event.\n\n-As Blue Team, obtaining Credits will be your biggest challenge, especially since Fountain income is greatly reduced. Pool Credits with other players to spawn a vehicle capable of reaching and destroying the Outlaw as quickly as possible.\n\n-As the Outlaw, staying in one place can be dangerous. Spawn a vehicle as soon as possible, either to escape impending threats or to collect Eternity Gems. Remember that your BaseCenter has little value in this Event, so don't waste time trying to defend it.\n\n",
            "**APOCALYPSE**\n\nObjective: Survive until the time runs out.\nRules: Attacking players is only allowed if survival is at stake.\nLives: 1-3\nAverage length: 10-30 minutes\n\n-MeteorShower Apocalypse is exactly what it sounds like - destructive meteors will rain from the skies, each of which having the power to destroy entire cities. Driving a fast land or sea vehicle can help to dodge the incoming meteors, but air vehicles will quickly be struck down. The frequency of the meteors increases as the time limit approaches.\n\n-Singularity Apocalypse unleashes self-replicating nanobots upon the world. Too small to be seen individually, these nightmarish creations drift through the air and seek out other colonies of their kind, growing into a tornado-like swarm which devours parts in its path. As the drifting nanobots accumulate in your body, they will increasingly attempt to link up with the nanobots inside other players - with fatal results for the both of you. Stay as far as possible from other players, but beware of the main swarm. Also keep in mind that the nanobots have a much greater vertical range than horizontal.\n\n-Annihilation Apocalypse summons Pelot, the dreaded final boss of Scarlet Skies. Though it is possible to kill Pelot, the reverse will usually happen as Pelot is armed to the teeth with unique weapons, moves incredibly fast, and is very easy to anger. Your best bet is to hide and pray that the time will run out before you're next.\n\n-GreatFreeze Apocalypse is the most in-depth of the four, but also requires the most preparation and knowledge of the game. As the planet rapidly plunges into a new Ice Age, nearly every source of heat or electricity will freeze over or shut down. Your only hope is the ability of Bogies to generate energy at very cold temperatures, allowing the construction of eternal engines - electric locomotives able to travel around a loop of Track virtually forever. This only works on Track sections the Bogie has not recently traveled upon, meaning a very long, circular railroad will be required beforehand. As a conductor, you may encounter various dangers on your journey - derailments, collisions with other locomotives, loss of power from stopping too long or traveling a recently traveled section, frostbite (from being exposed on any side to the outdoors), Track blockages, poor Track layout, and more. After the initial snowstorm ends, New Eden - a spot of warmth marked by red particles - may appear anywhere on the map, where survival is possible without a train.\n\n-Undying adds an extra hazard to the selected Apocalypse in the form of zombies, the reanimated corpses of killed players. These aren't your typical slow, lumbering undead - they run three times as fast as a player, can leap over buildings, and kill with a single touch, instantly converting the victim into another zombie.\n\n",
            "**GAUNTLET**\n\nObjective: Prevent Red Team from reaching the goal until the time runs out.\nRules: Only enemy team may be attacked.\nLives: Unlimited\nAverage length: 20 minutes\n\n-Blue Team members start out with 10x as many Credits as Red Team, but receive no automatic income. Capturing Fountains is vital to keeping up a long-term defense. In Intense mode, however, both teams start with the same amount.\n\n-The terrain within the gauntlet may be flat or rough. This can pose a challenge to some kinds of vehicles which may be very fast on flat ground but are mediocre at climbing slopes.\n\n-Any Blue Team parts in the gauntlet will quickly be destroyed.\n\n-The gauntlet has a height limit of 1000 studs. Keep this in mind when flying aircraft on Red Team.\n\n",
            "**ANARCHY**\n\nObjective: Survive until half of all players are out.\nRules: None.\nLives: 1-3\nAverage length: 30 minutes\n\n-Anarchy has no specific strategies or additional rules.\n\n"

Once all 5 Gems are loaded into\nthe Eternity Glove, the outlaw may click anywhere to commit the Snap and win the event.\n\n-As Blue Team, obtaining Credits will be your biggest challenge, especially since Fountain income is greatly\nreduced. Pool Credits with other players to spawn a vehicle capable of reaching and destroying the Outlaw as\nquickly as possible.\n\n-As the Outlaw, staying in one place can be dangerous. Spawn a vehicle as soon as possible, either to escape\nimpending threats or to collect Eternity Gems. Remember that your BaseCenter has little value in this Event,\nso don't waste time trying to defend it.\n\nAPOCALYPSE\n\n<font color=\"rgb(255,255,0)\">Objective: Survive until the time runs out.</font>\n<font color=\"rgb(255,255,0)\">Rules: Attacking players is only allowed if survival is at stake.</font>\n<font color=\"rgb(255,255,0)\">Lives: 1-3</font>\n<font color=\"rgb(255,255,0)\">Average length: 10-30 minutes</font>\n\n-MeteorShower Apocalypse is exactly what it sounds like - destructive meteors will rain from the skies, each\nof which having the power to destroy entire cities. Driving a fast land or sea vehicle can help to dodge the\nincoming meteors, but air vehicles will quickly be struck down. The frequency of the meteors increases as the\ntime limit approaches.\n\n-Singularity Apocalypse unleashes self-replicating nanobots upon the world. Too small to be seen individually,\nthese nightmarish creations drift through the air and seek out other colonies of their kind, growing into a \ntornado-like swarm which devours parts in its path. As the drifting nanobots accumulate in your body, they \nwill increasingly attempt to link up with the nanobots inside other players - with fatal results for the both \nof you. Stay as far as possible from other players, but beware of the main swarm. Also keep in mind that the \nnanobots have a much greater vertical range than horizontal.\n\n-Annihilation Apocalypse summons Pelot, the dreaded final boss of Scarlet Skies. Though it is possible to kill \nPelot, the reverse will usually happen as Pelot is armed to the teeth with unique weapons, moves incredibly fast, \nand is very easy to anger. Your best bet is to hide and pray that the time will run out before you're next.\n\n-GreatFreeze Apocalypse is the most in-depth of the four, but also requires the most preparation and knowledge of \nthe game. As the planet rapidly plunges into a new Ice Age, nearly every source of heat or electricity will \nfreeze over or shut down. Your only hope is the ability of Bogies to generate energy at very cold temperatures, \nallowing the construction of eternal engines - electric locomotives able to travel around a loop of Track virtually \nforever. This only works on Track sections the Bogie has not recently traveled upon, meaning a very long, circular \nrailroad will be required beforehand. As a conductor, you may encounter various dangers on your journey - derailments, \ncollisions with other locomotives, loss of power from stopping too long or traveling a recently traveled section, \nfrostbite (from being exposed on any side to the outdoors), Track blockages, poor Track layout, and more. After the\ninitial snowstorm ends, New Eden - a spot of warmth marked by red particles - may appear anywhere on the map, where \nsurvival is possible without a train.\n\n-Undying adds an extra hazard to the selected Apocalypse in the form of zombies, the reanimated corpses of killed\nplayers. These aren't your typical slow, lumbering undead - they run three times as fast as a player, can leap\nover buildings, and kill with a single touch, instantly converting the victim into another zombie.\n\nGAUNTLET\n\n<font color=\"rgb(255,255,0)\">Objective: Prevent Red Team from reaching the goal until the time runs out.</font>\n<font color=\"rgb(255,255,0)\">Rules: Only enemy team may be attacked.</font>\n<font color=\"rgb(255,255,0)\">Lives: Unlimited</font>\n<font color=\"rgb(255,255,0)\">Average length: 20 minutes</font>\n\n-Blue Team members start out with 10x as many Credits as Red Team, but receive no automatic income. Capturing Fountains\nis vital to keeping up a long-term defense. In Intense mode, however, both teams start with the same amount.\n\n-The terrain within the gauntlet may be flat or rough. This can pose a challenge to some kinds of vehicles which may\nbe very fast on flat ground but are mediocre at climbing slopes.\n\n-Any Blue Team parts in the gauntlet will quickly be destroyed.\n\n-The gauntlet has a height limit of 1000 studs. Keep this in mind when flying aircraft on Red Team.\n\nANARCHY\n\n<font color=\"rgb(255,255,0)\">Objective: Survive until half of all players are out.</font>\n<font color=\"rgb(255,255,0)\">Rules: None.</font>\n<font color=\"rgb(255,255,0)\">Lives: 1-3</font>\n<font color=\"rgb(255,255,0)\">Average length: 30 minutes</font>\n\n-Anarchy has no specific strategies or additional rules.\n",

Each firearm is identified with a code to determine its type and abilities:\n\ncategory;caliber;ammo type;magazine capacity or barrels;barrel length or fuse length\n\nAdditional list entries after \"length\" are optional and will apply special configurations to gun-type firearms. This excludes Grenades and Rocket Launchers.\n\nWeight is a property of Firearms which incurs penalties at certain amounts:\n\n20+ Weight: Requires preparation time after being equipped. This increases with further weight.\n50+ Weight: Requires a stationary stand to fire. Left-click to deploy the stand, unequip to retract.\n80+ Weight: Cannot be stored in inventory; unequipping the Firearm will drop it on the ground.\n\nPress R to manually reload a Firearm if the magazine is partially empty.\n\n**CATEGORIES**\n\n1: Muzzleloader. (Iron, Cotton, Flint) Inaccurate, slow to reload.\n2: Grenade. (Iron, Cotton, Flint) Explosive grenade. Does not use SPECIALS.\n3: Breechloader. (Iron, Diamond) Quick reload, accurate.\n4: Revolver. (Iron, Diamond) Inaccurate, holds up to 10 shots.\n5: Megagun. (Iron, Diamond, Aramid) Fires large, powerful shots. Inaccurate and slow, holds up to 10 shots.\n6: Rocket Launcher. (Aluminium, Nitroglycerin) Fires explosive rockets. Slow. Does not use SPECIALS.\n7: Semi-Automatic. (Titanium) Accurate.\n8: Automatic. (Titanium) Rapid-firing.\n9: Minigun. (Titanium, Mercury) Extremely rapid fire, inaccurate. Slow to reload.\n\n**CALIBERS**\n\nHigher calibers deal more damage but reduce refire rate. Grenade and rocket range is also reduced. All categories use 0-9.\n\n**AMMO TYPES**\n\nAmmo type can be changed after the Firearm is created by selecting the Produce GUI's Ammo button and hovering over a part.\n\n1: (Iron) Standard shot.\n2: (Copper) +Reload, -Damage\n3: (Uranium) +Damage\n4: (Neodymium) Ricochet shot. -Reload\n5: (Magnesium) Chance to set targets on fire based on caliber. -Damage\n6: (Toxin) Interrupts ranged hand weapons and drains health over time. -Damage\n7: (Silicon) Concusses nearest pawn (through walls if previously hit). -Refire, -Damage\n8: (Steel) Flings light objects.
